        <p>
          Prior to my current job, I was a Quality Assurance Inspector employed for the Department of the Navy (USA),
          focusing on the repair and maintenance of Trident Submarines. I am currently employed at a German company who
          specialises in the cultivation of King Oyster and Shiitake mushrooms for sale and consumption purposes. This was
          a far cry from my prior career path and expertise, but was a change made out of love and a need to be closer to my
          partner.<br><br>I just happened to stumble upon coding/programming one day and it's dominated my attention ever since. My
          hope is to continue to learn and grow this new skillset, allowing me to move away from my current career path and
          into a field that far better suits my wants, needs, and newly found passion. I have no immediate goals or expectations
          of learning to code. The tech industry is a vast, ever changing, and exciting field. I hope my path presents itself
          over the next couple months while becoming more familiar with coding and development.
